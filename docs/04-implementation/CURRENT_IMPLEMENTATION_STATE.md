# Current Implementation State

## Purpose of this file

This file is the rolling orientation point for the current implementation state of the repository.

It should stay concise and current-facing.
It is not a historical changelog and not a replacement for per-pass execution reports.

---

## Current Phase

**Layer 6 entered: `integration-contracts` surface semantics are now materialized on top of completed core/contour/trust layers.**

The repository now has ten packages from the canonical sequence.

---

## Current Strongest Completed Layer

The strongest completed code layers are now:

1. `packages/core-foundation`
2. `packages/core-domain`
3. `packages/persistence-contracts`
4. `packages/governance`
5. `packages/read-path`
6. `packages/pack-loop`
7. `packages/write-path`
8. `packages/handoff`
9. `packages/audit-eval`
10. `packages/integration-contracts`

`integration-contracts` now provides provider-neutral surface contracts for invocation/request/response, operation/tool linkage, capability descriptors, and typed surface error shapes.

---

## Current Code State

The repository now has:
- workspace scaffold for package-based implementation;
- `packages/core-foundation` semantic primitives;
- `packages/core-domain` canonical entity layer;
- `packages/persistence-contracts` persistence abstractions;
- `packages/governance` authority/evaluator primitives;
- `packages/read-path` selection and acquisition contour primitives;
- `packages/pack-loop` canonical bundle construction contour primitives;
- `packages/write-path` candidate-routing and governed-decisioning contour primitives;
- `packages/handoff` continuity-transfer contour primitives;
- `packages/audit-eval` trust-layer contracts;
- `packages/integration-contracts` provider-neutral surface contract layer.

The repository still does **not** have:
- `packages/provider-adapters`;
- `packages/system-assembly`;
- any concrete persistence adapter implementation;
- runtime MCP/API handler implementations.

---

## Current Recommended Package Sequence

The preferred early implementation sequence remains:

1. `core-foundation` (done)
2. `core-domain` (done)
3. `persistence-contracts` (done)
4. `governance` (done)
5. `read-path` (done)
6. `pack-loop` (done)
7. `write-path` (done)
8. `handoff` (done)
9. `audit-eval` (done)
10. `integration-contracts` (done)
11. `provider-adapters`
12. `system-assembly`

---

## Current Architectural Guardrails

The next coding pass must preserve these guardrails:
- do not mix contour responsibilities (`read`, `pack`, `write`, `handoff`);
- do not introduce concrete persistence implementation in contour packages;
- keep runtime/provider logic out of core contour and trust packages;
- keep `audit-eval` as trust contracts, not runtime monitoring behavior;
- keep `integration-contracts` as surface semantics only, not handler/transport execution;
- keep provider-specific behavior isolated to future `provider-adapters`.

---

## Current Documentation Protocol Status

Execution documentation protocol is exercised across ten bounded passes:
- `2026-04-21-01-core-foundation-skeleton.md`
- `2026-04-21-02-core-domain-canonical-entities.md`
- `2026-04-22-01-persistence-contracts-canonical-interfaces.md`
- `2026-04-22-02-governance-primitives-and-decisioning.md`
- `2026-04-22-03-read-path-primitives-and-selection.md`
- `2026-04-22-04-pack-loop-strategy-and-bundle-assembly.md`
- `2026-04-22-05-write-path-candidate-routing-and-governed-decisioning.md`
- `2026-04-22-06-handoff-continuity-transfer-primitives.md`
- `2026-04-22-07-audit-eval-traces-and-quality-contracts.md`
- `2026-04-22-08-integration-contracts-surface-shapes.md`

---

## Current Known Implementation Limits

Current limits after this pass:
- no provider-adapters package yet;
- no system-assembly package yet;
- no concrete persistence adapters yet;
- no runtime MCP/API handler execution yet.

---

## Next Recommended Bounded Pass

**Bounded Pass:** materialize `packages/provider-adapters` with canonical-to-provider projection shapes/primitives while preserving canonical contour semantics and avoiding runtime handler execution behavior.

---

## Notes for Next Agent or Session

When resuming:
- treat `integration-contracts` as static semantic surface contracts;
- keep provider-specific adaptation isolated to `provider-adapters`;
- preserve strict separation between contracts and execution layers.
