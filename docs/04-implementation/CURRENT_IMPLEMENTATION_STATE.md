# Current Implementation State

## Purpose of this file

This file is the rolling orientation point for the current implementation state of the repository.

It should stay concise and current-facing.
It is not a historical changelog and not a replacement for per-pass execution reports.

---

## Current Phase

**Internal runtime dispatch skeleton pass completed across `runtime-surface` and `system-assembly`.**

The repository remains at thirteen materialized packages and now includes a first internal dispatch planning skeleton without actual runtime/transport/provider execution.

---

## Current Strongest Completed Layer

The strongest completed code layers are now:

1. `packages/core-foundation`
2. `packages/core-domain`
3. `packages/persistence-contracts`
4. `packages/governance`
5. `packages/read-path`
6. `packages/pack-loop`
7. `packages/write-path`
8. `packages/handoff`
9. `packages/audit-eval`
10. `packages/integration-contracts`
11. `packages/provider-adapters`
12. `packages/system-assembly`
13. `packages/runtime-surface`

The strongest current bounded state is runtime-boundary + internal dispatch skeleton contracts (lookup/resolution/validation/planning/result normalization), still execution-free.

---

## Current Code State

The repository now has:
- workspace scaffold for package-based implementation;
- `packages/core-foundation` semantic primitives;
- `packages/core-domain` canonical entity layer;
- `packages/persistence-contracts` persistence abstractions;
- `packages/governance` authority/evaluator primitives;
- `packages/read-path` selection and acquisition contour primitives;
- `packages/pack-loop` canonical bundle construction contour primitives;
- `packages/write-path` candidate-routing and governed-decisioning contour primitives;
- `packages/handoff` continuity-transfer contour primitives;
- `packages/audit-eval` trust-layer contracts;
- `packages/integration-contracts` provider-neutral surface contract layer;
- `packages/provider-adapters` edge projection/normalization layer;
- `packages/system-assembly` composition/wiring and internal dispatch skeleton contracts;
- `packages/runtime-surface` entrypoint/handler-shape layer plus normalized runtime invocation intake contracts.

Recent internal-dispatch outcomes:
- added normalized runtime invocation intake shapes in `runtime-surface`;
- added internal dispatch vocabularies for warning/unsupported/result statuses;
- added operation lookup and handler resolution primitives;
- added dependency validation primitives for internal dispatch;
- added contour invocation boundary contracts and dispatch planning shapes;
- added normalized internal dispatch result shapes;
- added internal runtime dispatch pipeline skeleton that plans only and does not execute contour pipelines.

The repository still does **not** have:
- any concrete persistence adapter implementation;
- runtime MCP/API handler implementations;
- provider SDK transport execution implementations;
- actual contour invocation execution from internal dispatch.

## Current Recommended Package Sequence

The preferred early implementation sequence remains:

1. `core-foundation` (done)
2. `core-domain` (done)
3. `persistence-contracts` (done)
4. `governance` (done)
5. `read-path` (done)
6. `pack-loop` (done)
7. `write-path` (done)
8. `handoff` (done)
9. `audit-eval` (done)
10. `integration-contracts` (done)
11. `provider-adapters` (done)
12. `system-assembly` (done)
13. `runtime-surface` (done)

---

## Current Architectural Guardrails

The next coding pass must preserve these guardrails:
- do not mix contour responsibilities (`read`, `pack`, `write`, `handoff`);
- do not introduce concrete persistence implementation in contour packages;
- keep runtime/provider logic out of core contour and trust packages;
- keep `audit-eval` as trust contracts, not runtime monitoring behavior;
- keep `integration-contracts` as surface semantics only, not handler/transport execution;
- keep `provider-adapters` as edge projection/normalization only, not runtime transport execution;
- keep `system-assembly` as composition/wiring/internal dispatch planning only, not runtime execution layer;
- keep `runtime-surface` as entrypoint and handler-shape contracts only, not runtime dispatch/transport execution.

## Current Known Implementation Limits

Current limits after this pass:
- no concrete persistence adapters yet;
- no runtime MCP/API handler execution yet;
- no provider SDK transport execution yet;
- no external transport/integration handler runtime yet;
- no actual contour invocation execution in internal dispatch skeleton yet.

---

## Next Recommended Bounded Pass

**Bounded Pass:** integrate internal runtime dispatch skeleton with `system-assembly` bootstrap/validation reporting path (contract-level only), still deferring actual contour execution and transport/provider runtime behavior.

---

## Notes for Next Agent or Session

When resuming:
- treat `integration-contracts` as static semantic surface contracts;
- treat `provider-adapters` as edge projection/normalization contracts and primitives;
- treat `runtime-surface` as surface/intake contracts only;
- treat `system-assembly/runtime-dispatch-*` as planning/normalization skeleton only;
- preserve strict separation between planning contracts and real runtime execution layers.
