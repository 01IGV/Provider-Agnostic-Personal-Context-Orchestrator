# Current Implementation State

## Purpose of this file

This file is the rolling orientation point for the current implementation state of the repository.

It should stay concise and current-facing.
It is not a historical changelog and not a replacement for per-pass execution reports.

---

## Current Phase

**Proof output golden snapshot regression guard implemented on feature branch and locally verified with `npm run typecheck`, `npm run proof:end-to-end:non-executing`, and `npm run proof:end-to-end:non-executing:verify`.**

The repository remains at thirteen materialized packages and explicitly frames the system as a provider-agnostic context gateway and control plane for AI models and agents.

This pass added a deterministic golden snapshot and separate verification command for the stable proof artifact output. The goal is to prevent future changes from silently altering the contract-shaped JSON emitted by the deterministic local proof command.

The golden snapshot is stored at:

```text
docs/04-implementation/proof-artifacts/end-to-end-non-executing-proof.golden.json
```

The existing print command remains:

```bash
npm run proof:end-to-end:non-executing
```

The new verification command is:

```bash
npm run proof:end-to-end:non-executing:verify
```

It runs `npm run typecheck` first, composes the existing non-executing proof path, maps it to the stable proof artifact contract, checks runtime/action assertions remain `false`, and compares the deterministic JSON output against the golden snapshot.

No runtime handler, delivery runtime, actual publication delivery, actual dispatch execution, provider SDK, transport, concrete persistence, payment, IAM, policy engine, direct canonical context access, direct canonical writeback, runtime permission, real model call, real storage write, actual contour-execution behavior, or new placeholder layer was added.

## Current Strongest Completed Layer

The strongest completed code layers remain:

1. `packages/core-foundation`
2. `packages/core-domain`
3. `packages/persistence-contracts`
4. `packages/governance`
5. `packages/read-path`
6. `packages/pack-loop`
7. `packages/write-path`
8. `packages/handoff`
9. `packages/audit-eval`
10. `packages/integration-contracts`
11. `packages/provider-adapters`
12. `packages/system-assembly`
13. `packages/runtime-surface`

The strongest current bounded implementation state is now runtime-boundary + internal dispatch skeleton + dispatch-readiness reporting + contour-invocation gate + execution-handoff/attempt-trace + execution-result reconciliation + execution-completion ingress + execution-outcome finalization + execution-outcome publication/egress + publication-channel-binding/egress-gating + publication-dispatch-intent + delivery-precheck/handler-boundary + delivery-runtime-handoff placeholder contracts + delivery-runtime execution-attempt lifecycle contracts + delivery-runtime execution-attempt outcome placeholder normalization contracts + delivery-runtime execution-attempt outcome publication-preparation contracts + publication-preparation-to-dispatch-readiness contracts + dispatch-readiness-to-delivery-dispatch-intent contracts + delivery-dispatch-intent-to-delivery-dispatch-precheck contracts + delivery-chain boundary hardening + repo-first verdict after hardening + dispatch-readiness runtime boundary naming consistency fix + repo-first verdict before end-to-end non-executing proof path + end-to-end non-executing proof path composition + repo-first verdict after proof path + deterministic local proof command + repo-first verdict after deterministic local proof command + stable proof artifact contract + proof output golden snapshot regression guard.

All of this remains execution-free.

## Current Strategic / Architectural Alignment

The repository explicitly records the following positioning:

- MCP and API are protocol/integration surfaces, not the core control layer.
- The durable control point is the context gateway/control plane above protocol surfaces.
- The system should not be reduced to RAG, vector search, chat memory, a generic agent framework, or a plain MCP server.
- The primary system value is governed, bounded, auditable, provider-agnostic context authority.
- Identity, delegation, and provenance are foundational governance boundaries before actual runtime/handler execution.
- Payment and broader authorization rails are relevant future adjacency, but not current implementation scope.

The proof command, stable proof artifact contract, and golden snapshot regression guard remain non-executing proof infrastructure only. They do not imply runtime permission, delivery evidence, dispatch execution, publication delivery, model calls, storage writes, or direct canonical context access.

---

## Current Code State

The repository currently has:
- workspace scaffold for package-based implementation;
- `packages/core-foundation` semantic primitives;
- `packages/core-domain` canonical entity layer;
- `packages/persistence-contracts` persistence abstractions;
- `packages/governance` authority/evaluator primitives;
- `packages/read-path` selection and acquisition contour primitives;
- `packages/pack-loop` canonical bundle construction contour primitives;
- `packages/write-path` candidate-routing and governed-decisioning contour primitives;
- `packages/handoff` continuity-transfer contour primitives;
- `packages/audit-eval` trust-layer contracts;
- `packages/integration-contracts` provider-neutral surface contract layer;
- `packages/provider-adapters` edge projection/normalization layer;
- `packages/system-assembly` composition/wiring and internal dispatch skeleton contracts, including delivery-runtime execution-attempt lifecycle, outcome normalization, outcome publication-preparation, publication-preparation-to-dispatch-readiness, dispatch-readiness-to-delivery-dispatch-intent, delivery-dispatch-intent-to-delivery-dispatch-precheck contracts, end-to-end non-executing proof-path composition, and stable proof artifact contract;
- `packages/runtime-surface` entrypoint/handler-shape layer plus normalized runtime invocation intake contracts and delivery-adjacent envelopes;
- deterministic end-to-end non-executing proof path that composes the existing corridor without runtime behavior;
- deterministic local proof command exposed as `npm run proof:end-to-end:non-executing`;
- stable proof artifact summary contract exposed through `system-assembly`;
- golden snapshot regression guard exposed as `npm run proof:end-to-end:non-executing:verify`.

The repository still does **not** have:
- concrete persistence adapter implementation;
- runtime MCP/API handler implementations;
- delivery runtime implementation;
- actual publication delivery implementation;
- actual dispatch execution implementation;
- provider SDK transport execution implementations;
- actual contour invocation execution from internal dispatch;
- full auth/IAM implementation;
- payment or settlement rail implementation.

## Current Architectural Guardrails

The next coding pass must preserve these guardrails:
- do not mix contour responsibilities (`read`, `pack`, `write`, `handoff`);
- do not introduce concrete persistence implementation in contour packages;
- keep runtime/provider logic out of core contour and trust packages;
- keep `audit-eval` as trust contracts, not runtime monitoring behavior;
- keep `integration-contracts` as surface semantics only, not handler/transport/publication/dispatch/precheck execution;
- keep `provider-adapters` as edge-shape/primitives only, not runtime transport execution;
- keep `system-assembly` as composition/wiring/internal dispatch planning/normalization/preparation/readiness/intent/precheck-shaping/proof-composition/proof-artifact-contract only, not runtime execution layer;
- keep `runtime-surface` as entrypoint and handler-shape/envelope contracts only, not runtime dispatch/transport/publication/precheck execution;
- keep scripts/local proof commands and golden snapshot verification as non-executing proof signals only, not runtime command surfaces;
- keep proof artifact contracts as stable non-executing output shapes, not runtime permission or delivery evidence;
- preserve the distinction between gateway/control-plane authority and runtime/transport/publication/dispatch/precheck execution;
- preserve identity, delegation, and provenance boundaries before actual handlers are implemented;
- do not let MCP/API surfaces become the core semantic authority;
- do not expand into payments, settlement, full enterprise IAM, or generic agent-economy platform behavior at this stage;
- do not interpret execution-attempt lifecycle, normalized outcome, publication-preparation, dispatch-readiness, delivery-dispatch intent, delivery-dispatch precheck, proof-path artifacts, local proof command output, stable proof artifact contract, or golden snapshot verification as permission for handler invocation, delivery execution, actual publication, actual dispatch, or runtime permission.

## Current Documentation Protocol Status

Execution documentation protocol is exercised across bounded passes, including through:
- `2026-04-24-41-deterministic-local-proof-command.md`
- `2026-04-24-42-repo-first-verdict-after-deterministic-local-proof-command.md`
- `2026-04-24-43-stable-proof-artifact-contract.md`
- `2026-04-24-44-proof-output-golden-snapshot-regression-guard.md`

## Current Known Implementation Limits

Current limits after this proof output golden snapshot regression guard pass:
- no concrete persistence adapters yet;
- no runtime MCP/API handler execution yet;
- no delivery runtime implementation yet;
- no actual publication delivery implementation yet;
- no actual dispatch execution implementation yet;
- no provider SDK transport execution yet;
- no external transport/integration handler runtime yet;
- no actual contour invocation execution in internal dispatch skeleton yet;
- no dedicated type-level identity/delegation/provenance contract package yet;
- no full auth/IAM or payment/settlement implementation, intentionally out of current scope;
- end-to-end proof-path artifacts, deterministic proof command output, stable proof artifact contracts, and golden snapshot verification remain proof-composition only and still do not imply actual contour execution, runtime permission, model call, storage write, handler invocation, dispatch execution, or delivery.

---

## Next Recommended Bounded Pass

**Bounded Pass:** if this branch is merged, perform a narrow post-merge state alignment and repo-first verdict for the next implementation direction after proof output golden snapshot regression guard.

Do not add runtime handlers, MCP/API routes/controllers, dispatch execution, publication delivery, delivery runtime, provider SDK calls, transport execution, concrete persistence, auth/IAM, payment rails, contour execution, real model calls, real storage writes, or another placeholder layer unless explicitly scoped by a new bounded implementation pass.

---

## Notes for Next Agent or Session

When resuming:
- treat local proof scripts/commands and golden snapshot verification as non-executing proof signals only;
- treat `system-assembly` proof-path and stable proof artifact modules as proof-composition/proof-artifact-contract skeletons only;
- preserve strict separation between proof infrastructure and real runtime execution layers;
- treat MCP/API as surfaces, not core control authority;
- treat gateway/control-plane as the authority-bearing context mediation boundary;
- do not expand into actual dispatch execution, actual publication delivery, payment rails, settlement, or generic agent framework behavior unless explicitly scoped later.
