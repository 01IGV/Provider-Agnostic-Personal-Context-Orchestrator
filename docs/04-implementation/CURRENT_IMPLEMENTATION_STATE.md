# Current Implementation State

## Purpose of this file

This file is the rolling orientation point for the current implementation state of the repository.

It should stay concise and current-facing.
It is not a historical changelog and not a replacement for per-pass execution reports.

## Current Phase

**Authority-boundary denial proof integration merged to `main` and locally verified.**

`main` now includes machine-checkable default-deny proof for the first auth/IAM-adjacent authority boundary.

This is a proof/boundary verification layer only.

It is not an auth/IAM implementation, not an MCP/API implementation, not a policy engine, not a permission grant, and not a runtime execution pass.

The new boundary makes authority, identity, delegation, provenance, permission scope, policy context, and audit trace refs explicit as shape-level placeholders before any real MCP/API route/controller/server boundary is considered.

The boundary remains default-deny:

- `auth_iam_adjacent: true`;
- `authority_boundary: true`;
- `identity_boundary: true`;
- `delegation_boundary: true`;
- `provenance_boundary: true`;
- `permission_boundary: true`;
- `authentication_implemented: false`;
- `authorization_implemented: false`;
- `iam_provider_integrated: false`;
- `session_management_implemented: false`;
- `token_validation_implemented: false`;
- `policy_engine_integrated: false`;
- `permission_grant_issued: false`;
- `runtime_permission_granted: false`;
- `mcp_route_permission_granted: false`;
- `api_route_permission_granted: false`;
- `actual_contour_execution_allowed_now: false`.

The authority-boundary denial proof verifies:

- `auth_iam_adjacent: true`;
- `authority_boundary: true`;
- `identity_boundary: true`;
- `delegation_boundary: true`;
- `provenance_boundary: true`;
- `permission_boundary: true`;
- `authentication_implemented: false`;
- `authorization_implemented: false`;
- `iam_provider_integrated: false`;
- `session_management_implemented: false`;
- `token_validation_implemented: false`;
- `policy_engine_integrated: false`;
- `permission_grant_issued: false`;
- `runtime_permission_granted: false`;
- `mcp_route_permission_granted: false`;
- `api_route_permission_granted: false`;
- `actual_contour_execution_allowed_now: false`;
- `denial_flags_all_false: true`;
- `failure_count: 0`.

Local verification passed for the merged `main` state:

```bash
npm install
npm run typecheck
npm run proof:end-to-end:non-executing:verify
npm run proof:invocation-denial:verify
npm run proof:handler-boundary-denial:verify
npm run proof:surface-boundary-denial:verify
npm run proof:authority-boundary-denial:verify
```

Observed local verification results:

- `npm install`: passed, `up to date`;
- `npm run typecheck`: passed;
- `stable_proof_artifact_matches_golden_snapshot`;
- `invocation_denial_default_deny_verified`;
- `handler_boundary_denial_default_deny_verified`;
- `surface_boundary_denial_default_deny_verified`;
- `authority_boundary_denial_default_deny_verified`.

GitHub Actions observation note:

- PR #3 for `feat/authority-boundary-denial-proof-integration` passed GitHub Actions `Proof Output Regression` run `24988208252`;
- PR #3 was merged to `main` as `49a42d8`;
- local `main` is up to date with `origin/main` at `49a42d8`;
- GitHub connector did not return push-triggered workflow runs for merge commit `49a42d8`;
- no CI failure was observed after merge, but push-run status for the squash commit could not be independently confirmed from this session.

Runtime remains closed:

- no real auth/IAM implementation;
- no login/session management;
- no token validation;
- no OAuth/OIDC/SAML/JWT integration;
- no IAM provider adapter;
- no policy engine implementation or execution;
- no permission grant logic;
- no MCP server;
- no MCP tool registration;
- no MCP resource registration;
- no API routes;
- no API controllers;
- no runtime handlers;
- no dispatch execution;
- no publication delivery;
- no delivery runtime;
- no provider SDK calls;
- no transport execution;
- no concrete persistence adapters;
- no direct canonical context access;
- no direct canonical writeback;
- no real model calls;
- no real storage writes;
- no runtime permission granted;
- no actual contour execution.

## Current Strongest Completed Layer

The repository currently has thirteen materialized packages:

1. `packages/core-foundation`
2. `packages/core-domain`
3. `packages/persistence-contracts`
4. `packages/governance`
5. `packages/read-path`
6. `packages/pack-loop`
7. `packages/write-path`
8. `packages/handoff`
9. `packages/audit-eval`
10. `packages/integration-contracts`
11. `packages/provider-adapters`
12. `packages/system-assembly`
13. `packages/runtime-surface`

The strongest current bounded implementation state on `main` is now:

- end-to-end non-executing proof path;
- deterministic local proof command;
- stable proof artifact contract;
- golden snapshot regression guard;
- CI proof output regression workflow;
- first executable-adjacent contour invocation seam;
- invocation denial proof integration;
- first runtime-adjacent handler boundary contracts;
- handler-boundary denial proof integration;
- first MCP/API-adjacent surface boundary contracts;
- surface-boundary denial proof integration;
- first auth/IAM-adjacent authority boundary contracts;
- authority-boundary denial proof integration;
- local verification green for all current proof commands.

All of this remains execution-free.

## Current Strategic / Architectural Alignment

The repository explicitly records the following positioning:

- MCP and API are protocol/integration surfaces, not the core control layer.
- The durable control point is the context gateway/control plane above protocol surfaces.
- The system should not be reduced to RAG, vector search, chat memory, a generic agent framework, or a plain MCP server.
- The primary system value is governed, bounded, auditable, provider-agnostic context authority.
- Identity, delegation, and provenance are foundational governance boundaries before actual runtime/handler/protocol execution.
- Payment and broader authorization rails are relevant future adjacency, but not current implementation scope.

The auth/IAM-adjacent authority boundary remains contract-only. It does not imply authentication, authorization, token validation, session management, IAM provider integration, policy engine execution, permission grant, runtime permission, MCP/API route/controller implementation, MCP tool/resource registration, handler invocation, provider calls, model calls, storage writes, direct canonical context access, or actual contour invocation.

---

## Current Code State

The repository currently has:

- `packages/governance` auth/IAM-adjacent authority boundary vocabularies, types, and builder;
- `packages/system-assembly` deterministic composition from surface-boundary denial proof into auth/IAM-adjacent authority boundary;
- `packages/system-assembly` authority-boundary denial proof types, builder, deterministic summary, failure finder, and verification summary;
- `scripts/verify-authority-boundary-denial-proof.mjs`;
- `npm run proof:authority-boundary-denial:verify`;
- CI `Proof Output Regression` step for authority-boundary denial proof;
- exports for the new authority boundary contracts and composition helpers;
- `docs/04-implementation/execution-reports/2026-04-24-61-first-auth-iam-adjacent-authority-boundary-contracts.md`.

The repository still does **not** have:

- real auth/IAM implementation;
- login/session management;
- token validation;
- OAuth/OIDC/SAML/JWT integration;
- IAM provider adapter;
- policy engine implementation or execution;
- permission grant logic;
- MCP server implementation;
- MCP tool/resource registration;
- API route/controller implementation;
- runtime MCP/API handler implementation;
- actual handler execution;
- actual dispatch execution;
- actual publication delivery;
- provider SDK transport execution;
- concrete persistence adapter implementation;
- actual contour invocation execution;
- payment or settlement rail implementation.

---

## Current Architectural Guardrails

The next pass must preserve these guardrails:

- keep `governance` as authority/governance semantics only;
- keep `integration-contracts` as surface semantics only;
- keep `system-assembly` as composition/proof/boundary integration only;
- keep `runtime-surface` as handler-shape/boundary contracts only;
- keep proof scripts as non-executing verification signals;
- do not interpret any proof, seam, boundary, or CI signal as runtime permission;
- do not add real auth/IAM implementation, token validation, sessions, IAM provider calls, policy engine execution, permission grants, MCP server, MCP tool/resource registration, API routes/controllers, runtime handlers, provider SDK calls, transport execution, concrete persistence, payment rails, real model calls, real storage writes, or actual contour execution.

## Current Documentation Protocol Status

Execution documentation protocol is exercised across bounded passes, including through:

- `2026-04-24-59-surface-boundary-denial-proof-integration.md`
- `2026-04-24-60-repo-first-verdict-after-surface-boundary-denial-proof.md`

- `2026-04-27-62-state-next-step-alignment-after-first-auth-iam-authority-boundary.md`
- `2026-04-27-63-repo-first-verdict-after-first-auth-iam-authority-boundary.md`
- `2026-04-27-64-authority-boundary-denial-proof-integration.md`

## Current Known Implementation Limits

Current limits after first auth/IAM-adjacent authority boundary contracts:

- GitHub Actions PR run for authority-boundary denial proof passed, but push-run observation for merge commit `49a42d8` could not be independently confirmed through the connector in this session;
- no concrete persistence adapters yet;
- no runtime MCP/API handler execution yet;
- no MCP/API route/controller implementation yet;
- no MCP server implementation yet;
- no MCP tool or resource registration yet;
- no delivery runtime implementation yet;
- no actual publication delivery implementation yet;
- no actual dispatch execution implementation yet;
- no provider SDK transport execution yet;
- no external transport/integration handler runtime yet;
- no actual contour invocation execution in internal dispatch skeleton yet;
- no real auth/IAM implementation yet;
- no token validation, session management, IAM provider integration, policy engine execution, or permission grant yet;
- no full payment/settlement implementation, intentionally out of current scope.

## Next Recommended Bounded Pass

**Bounded Pass:** agent context request boundary contracts.

The authority-boundary denial proof is present on `main`, local verification remains green, PR CI was observed green, and repo-first verdict found no concrete blocker before moving into the first AI-facing request/response contract layer.

Recommended branch:

`feat/agent-context-request-boundary-contracts`

That pass should define the first AI-agent context request boundary contract and bounded context response envelope.

Expected bounded scope:

- add contract-only AI-agent context request shape;
- add contract-only bounded context response envelope shape;
- carry authority, provenance, permission, and audit refs through the envelope;
- preserve default-deny execution posture;
- expose deterministic builders/summaries in the appropriate package boundary;
- add an execution report and update rolling state docs.

Do not add real auth/IAM implementation, token validation, sessions, IAM provider calls, policy engine execution, permission grants, MCP server, MCP tool/resource registration, API routes/controllers, runtime handlers, provider SDK calls, transport execution, concrete persistence, payment rails, contour execution, real model calls, real storage writes, or another placeholder layer.

## Notes for Next Agent or Session

Treat auth/IAM-adjacent authority boundary artifacts as boundary contracts only.

They are not authentication, not authorization, not token validation, not session management, not IAM provider integration, not policy engine execution, not permission grants, not runtime permission, not MCP/API route access, not handler invocation, not dispatch execution, not provider execution, and not evidence of actual contour execution.
